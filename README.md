Data Analysis Bootcamp Module 3 - Python Challenge

PyBank_Project
This project delves into a dataset of financial records to shed light on the company's financial health. It covers a variety of analyses, including counting the total number of months, summing up the overall profits and losses, calculating the average changes in profits and losses, and pinpointing the months with the highest and lowest profits.
There are 3 files:
  1. main.py
  2. budget_data.csv
  3. output file = financial_analysis/txt

The script executes the following operations:
1. Computes the total count of months in the dataset.
2. Calculates the cumulative total of profits/losses.
3. Determines the month-to-month changes in profits/losses and computes the average of these changes.
4. Finds the highest and lowest profit changes along with their corresponding dates.
5. Outputs the analysis results to the terminal.
6. Writes the analysis summary to analysis/financial_analysis.txt.
